\section{PyTexPlot}

This is an example of the pytexplot package.

After defining the directories
\pytexplotscripts{scripts}
\pytexplotplots{figures}
(default is in the document folder)
We can start including the plot:

\includepytexplot[width=\linewidth]{plot1}

The script that generates the plot is only ran when the image is deleted or the script has changed, 
all of this is checked by pytexplot.py.

\includepytexplot[width=\linewidth]{plot2}

\end{document}
